# Vietnam’s top 100 dishes, food gifts announced
Complied by the Vietnam Records Organization (Vietkings) and Vietnam Top Center (VietTop), the list includes dishes and food gifts from each of Vietnam’s 63 provinces and municipalities.

In order to qualify for the list, dishes must be a reflection of Vietnamese culture, made from natural ingredients, healthy and widely available.

Specialties selected must meet key criteria such as reflecting Vietnamese characteristics.

The project to compile the list began in 2012. 

During the past decade, Vietkings has evaluated over 500 dishes and specialties from across the nation before settling on a finalized ranking.

The noodle dishes which made the list include ‘bun nuoc leo’ from Soc Trang, ‘banh canh Ben Co’ from Tra Vinh, ‘pho kho Gia Lai’ from Gia Lai, ‘bun cha ca Quy Nhon’ from Binh Dinh, ‘bun bo Hue’ from Hue, and ‘banh da cua’ from Hai Phong.

In the ‘cakes’ category are ‘banh khot’ from Ba Ria - Vung Tau, ‘banh tam bi’ from Bac Lieu, and ‘banh gia Go Cong’ from Tien Giang. 


Salads on the list include 'sau dau' dried snakehead fish salad from An Giang and sardin salad from Kien Giang.

The list of gift specialties includes Thoai Son dried snakehead from An Giang, Ben Tre coconut candy, Lai Thieu mangosteens from Binh Duong, honey from U Minh forest in Ca Mau, shrimp salt from Tay Ninh, and Ly Son garlic from Quang Ngai.

All foods listed in the two categories will be issued certificates and medals from VietTop and a ceremony honoring the dishes will be held on April 26.
